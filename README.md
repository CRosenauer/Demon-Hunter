# About
This game is a 2D action-platformer heavily inspired by (if not a blatant rip-off of) the old-school NES Castlevania games. The scope of this project was to create a reasonably polished, demo-like experience following the Castlevania formula. To that extent, I believe this project met it's goals. It is a competent action-platformer with a custom character controller, controller support, multiple collectable sub-weapons, various level transitions, and fluid gameplay to cutscene transitions.

Future plans are to refactor the movement controller and enemy/player controller logic to provide de-coupled and easier to use logic. The bulk of the work is complete, however I have not found the time to validate and patch the few remaining corner cases. Additionally, I hope to iterate on the gameplay to make it less derivative when my brainstorming provides an idea with sufficient potential.
